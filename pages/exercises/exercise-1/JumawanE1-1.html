		<br>
		<h2>About Myself</h2>
		<p>I am Miguel Luis Jumawan from the island of Siquijor. I am a first-year student in BS Computer Science. I chose this course because I am interested in machine learning algorithms. I can write a bit of shell scripts (mostly bash or zsh), Python, C, and GDScript. Though I do not claim that I have mastered these programming languages, as I am also still learning.</p>
		<p>Apart from things about me that are related to my course, I also have hobbies that are not quite related to my course. For example, I can play the guitar very well. I have also tried learning the violin, but things were hard being self-taught, so I stopped. I also like working out and playing volleyball.</p><br>
		
		<h2>My Student Info</h2>
		<div>Course: BSCS</div><br>
		<div>Year Level: 1</div><br>
		<div>Subjects Enrolled: CCS 1, CCS 2, GE 10A, GE 4, GE 6, PEP 1, PE 1, CHS 1</div><br>
		
		<h2>My Goal</h2>
		<p>My goals for this academic year are to widen my knowledge about computers in general. I want to learn from the basics and reach the more complex or intermediate level while using the key basic concepts. I also want to make friends that I can make fun and cool projects with. Most importantly, I want to pass all my courses.</p>
