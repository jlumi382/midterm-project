        <p>Hello there! My name is Miguel Luis Jumawan. I first encountered programming in junior high school, and while I was fairly decent at it, I didn’t have the passion to code outside of my academic work. Because of this, I didn’t expect to pursue a Computer Science program in college. However, during my senior year, I began to truly enjoy coding when I was selected to represent my school in a team competition for a Science and Investigation project in the Mathematics category. My team was responsible for the mathematical aspects, and my role was to implement our ideas in code. We developed a ridge regression model to predict humidity levels in the municipalities of Siquijor. Participating in that contest sparked my interest, and I started exploring other fields, such as game development and creating command-line interface software.</p>
